## Replacement companion boundary

| Capability | Current status |
|---|---|
| Stock pairing and binding behavior | Observed |
| Runtime RFCOMM endpoint attribution | Complete in accepted r25.2 scope |
| Independent RFCOMM open/close | Device-qualified |
| Channel identity | SCN 3, DLCI 6, MTU 990 |
| Application bytes in accepted connection-only attempt | Proven zero in both directions |
| Stock ADB-toggle outbound message family | Four qualified messages attributed and decoded |
| Reply, authorization, integrity, and session binding | Unresolved |
| Independent Developer Mode sender | Not implemented; replay prohibited |
| Direct CXR-M experiment | r1 evidence retained; ownership classification withdrawn; runner disabled |
| Hi Rokid CXR-L client | Test 19 r2 accepted: firmware 1.22/1.23 PASS, no tested regression, r2.4 runtime repairs physically validated |
| Independent camera capture | Not yet tested |
| Independent microphone and speaker path | Not yet tested |
| Complete Hi Rokid replacement | Not built |

## On-glasses and firmware boundary

| Capability | Current status |
|---|---|
| Android/API identity | Android 12/API 32 observed |
| USB ADB | RSA-protected transport qualified while Developer Mode enabled |
| Ordinary APK lifecycle on Style | Not yet qualified |
| Privileged permission boundary | Not yet mapped |
| Live/OTA vbmeta correspondence | Read-only match established for the qualified chain |
| Repaired Magisk candidate | Accepted offline only; never booted or flashed |
| Proven recovery path for custom firmware | Not established |

## Recommended next gate

Test 19 r2 is complete and publication-closed. Test 20 r1 completed the exact
read-only CXR-L 1.0.1 static census, but its first sanitized classification is
withdrawn because class participation was propagated to unrelated members.
Test 20 r1.1 repairs that output offline with a nine-member descriptor-exact
runtime allowlist, two qualified Hi Rokid components, and explicit synthetic and
obfuscated surface labels. No device or Maven rerun is required. Subsequent
Test 20 stages may qualify bounded control-plane callbacks and then media only
where the attested surface supports it.
